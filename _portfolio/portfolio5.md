Reproduction of the paper ["Deep Attentive Learning for Stock Movement Prediction From Social Media Text and Company Correlations"](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.676.pdf")

We provide an alternative implementation of the model, and all the resources to run it, including how to extract and process wikirelations data (according to this [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3309547))

This code uses the [stokcnet dataset](https://github.com/yumoxu/stocknet-dataset)
