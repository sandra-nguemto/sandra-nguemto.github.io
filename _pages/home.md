I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Johns Hopkins University](https://hemi.jhu.edu/mseeura/) for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. Previously I was a  PhD candidate in Mathematics at the [University of Tennessee Knoxville](https://www.math.utk.edu), where I worked on quantum machine learning for commercial qunatum devices. 

I am broadly interested in Machine Learning within the scope of Data Assimilation, Quantum Computing and Finance.
